# Loan-Approval---Analytics-Vidhya

The Objective is to classify wheather a customer can be approved for loan based on some parameters like his education, No. of dependants, previous loan status etc.

I have Imported the data, analysed the necessary data, Cleansed, Imputed the Null values, Visualised and have plotted all the necessary graphs to understand the data.

For predicting wheather a customer can be approved for the loan, I have used 8 Different Models, Used the ROC curve and F1 score as a metric ( as the data was Imballanced). I have taken the Ensemble of those 8 models to predict the test dataset. I was able to achieve an Roc score of 0.78 for the test data.

I will be constantly updating this repo to improve the score!
